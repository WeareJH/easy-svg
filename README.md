##Minimal es6 starter project

Just enough to get you started with the next version of Javascript.

###Includes

1. *Babel*  - for compiling your es6 code back into es5
2. *jshint* - preconfigured for es6
2. *mocha*  - for writing tests in es6 also

###Usage.

1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm install`
3. work from the `src` directory only - files will be compiled back out into `lib` & `test`
3. use `npm run es6-watch` to have your files auto-compiled when you save
4. use `npm test` to lint your files, compile them, and run the unit test.
